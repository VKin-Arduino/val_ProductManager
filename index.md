## Hiya! I am Valentina Chinnici! 

I am Valentina Chinnici: a passionate, value-driven Product Manager with experience leading the development of complex digital and physical products & kits for STEAM Education, Maker Education, and SaaS. 
Since 2013 I’ve worked at STEAM, Education technology companies.


### Where I work

I am currently Product Owner at Arduino. In my current role, I am responsible for defining the roadmap, and product milestones, as well as managing the backlog on JIRA. I do also work on the product lifecycle as well as the go-to-market strategy in collaboration with the marketing team (I have a strong background in marketing). Although I believe the most exciting part of my job is to identify the _Jobs to be done_, and listening to the customers’ needs. 

I contributed to open-up a new market segment (middle school) expanding the product portfolio with the [Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab](https://store.arduino.cc/physics-lab): an educational kit which combines custom-made hardware, and firmware, based on the Arduino WiFi 1010 board, a dedicated CMS to host content (available in 6 languages) as well as additional learning/teaching materials, a BLE integration for the Google’s Science Journal App. I managed everything from competitors’ analysis, to the concept up until the deployment to the market by the announced deadline. 

To make the development possible I work across different internal teams (from Hardware to Firmware, and Software, to supply chain, etc.).
