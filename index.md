I am Valentina Chinnici: a passionate, value-driven Product Manager with experience leading the development of complex digital and physical products & kits for STEAM Education, Maker Education, and SaaS. 
Since 2013 I’ve worked at STEAM, Education technology companies.


### Where I work

I am currently Product Owner at Arduino. In my current role, I am responsible for defining the roadmap, and product milestones, as well as managing the backlog on JIRA. I do also work on the product lifecycle as well as the go-to-market strategy in collaboration with the marketing team (I have a strong background in marketing). Although I believe the most exciting part of my job is to identify the _Jobs to be done_, and listening to the customers’ needs. 

I contributed to open-up a new market segment (middle school) expanding the product portfolio with the [Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab](https://store.arduino.cc/physics-lab): an educational kit which combines custom-made hardware, and firmware, based on the Arduino WiFi 1010 board, a dedicated CMS to host content (available in 6 languages) as well as additional learning/teaching materials, a BLE integration for the Google’s Science Journal App. I managed everything from competitors’ analysis, to the concept up until the deployment to the market by the announced deadline. 

To make the development possible I work across different internal teams (from Hardware to Firmware, and Software, to supply chain, etc.). 

### How I work 

Research | Plan | Test & Iterate | Deploy
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Understand the _Job to be done_. Explore competitors. Identify strategic opportunities. Outline requirements. | Work cross-teams to build products that consistently combine compelling design, smooth interactions, functional code, streamlined production. | Test prototypes with final users. Iterate and improve. | Communicate. Create a compelling narrative for the customers. Create visuals for launch campaign. 

### Portfolio

#### Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab

Developed in partnership with Google, the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab is an Arduino-based physics lab, fully compatible with Google Science Journal available on Android.

##### Goal
Create a simple, affordable, out-of-the-box experience for Science teachers, teaching Physics. Open up a new Education Segment (middle school).

##### Approach
I started researching on the way teachers were using Arduino in the classroom, in order to figure out if there were new ways of promoting Arduino in a classroom setting. Arduino was already largely used in high-schools and universities as datalogger tool, or cheaper alternative to expensive lab equipment. We decided to allow also younger kids to experiment sciences with a more affordable approach, simple to integrate in the curriculum with guidelines to map lessons to regular curriculum, and easy for the teacher to setup. We came up with an integrated approach which is combining: custom-made hardware and assembly pieces, content for the teachers and students alike, and a custom integration for the open-source mobile platform to check the progress of the data stream (Google Science Journal). 

##### Results
Arduino was the only partner selected as official integration in the official Science Journal app for Android by Google. The kit was successfully tested in the classroom, and teachers loved the ease-of-use of the kit. The content, activities, hardware were built from scratch. Thanks to the integration between the physical kit and the digital contents and app, kids and teachers could really have a comprehensive educational experience. Due to the target audience we translated the content in several languages.

I love traveling and knowing local people. 

I have recently discovered a passion for hiking and I do that with my tiny dog Aldi (yes, the same name as the supermarket). 

I instituted a safe space for mental health in the workplace as a response to the current Covid-19 pandemic, providing colleagues with selected personal and mental wellbeing articles, healthy check-ins reminders, and promoting the importance of a positive workplace culture. I have also started an [Instagram account in Italian](https://www.instagram.com/scrignofelice/) to support people who struggle with mental health.
